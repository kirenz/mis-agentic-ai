### Custom Instructions in VS Code

Enhance Copilot's chat responses by automatically providing contextual details about your workflow, tools, or project. Instead of repeating this context in every query, you can set up a custom instructions file.

#### Setup Steps

1. Open [settings](vscode://settings/github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions) in VS Code.
2. Click **Edit in settings.json**.
3. Add the following entry:

    ```json
    "github.copilot.chat.codeGeneration.instructions": [
      {
        "file": "code-style.md"
      }
    ],
    ```

4. In your project root, create a `.github` folder.
5. Inside `.github`, add two files:
   - `copilot-instructions.md`
   - `code-style.md`

6. Write your custom instructions in these files to tailor Copilot's responses.
