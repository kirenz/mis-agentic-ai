The Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server enables native connectivity from Windows applications to Microsoft SQL Server and Azure SQL databases. It includes command-line tools such as `sqlcmd` and `bcp` for executing queries and bulk copy operations.

## ODBC Driver

Follow the steps below to install the ODBC Driver (version 18) and command-line tools on your Windows machine:

- [Installation Instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/odbc/download-odbc-driver-for-sql-server?view=sql-server-ver17)   

For most users, the "Download Microsoft ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server (x64)" installer is the right choice.

<!-- 
## Open Powershell

Click `Start`, search for **Powershell**, right-click the icon, and choose **Run as administrator**.

Running as administrator is required because the driver installers write to protected directories. Keep this elevated Powershell window open for the next steps.

## Update winget package sources

Modern Windows versions include `winget.exe`. From the elevated Powershell prompt run:

```bash
winget.exe upgrade --all
```

If `winget.exe` is not found, ensure you are on Windows 10 (build 1809+) or Windows 11 with the App Installer package installed.

## Install the Microsoft ODBC Driver and command-line tools

Use `winget.exe` from Git Bash to install Microsoft's official packages:

```bash
winget.exe install --id=Microsoft.ODBCDriverForSQLServer -e --source winget
```

Accept the license prompts when they appear. 

This command installs `sqlcmd` and `bcp` under `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\`.

```bash
winget.exe install --id=Microsoft.CommandLineUtilitiesForSqlServer -e --source winget
```

If the packages are not found, install them manually:

- [Packages](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/tools/sqlcmd/sqlcmd-download-install?view=sql-server-ver17&tabs=windows)

## Verify the installation

Close the elevated Git Bash window, then open a normal Git Bash session and run:

```bash
sqlcmd -?
```

You should see usage instructions. 

## Troubleshooting

If Windows cannot find `sqlcmd`, add its folder to the PATH environment variable:

1. Open **Settings** > **System** > **About** > **Advanced system settings**.
2. Click **Environment Variables…**.
3. Under **System variables**, select `Path` and click **Edit…**.
4. Add:
   - `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\170\Tools\Binn` (ODBC 17/18 tools)
   - `C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\Client SDK\ODBC\170\Tools\Binn\x64`
5. Close all dialogs with **OK** and reopen Git Bash.

Test that the ODBC driver is registered:

```bash
odbcconf.exe /S /Lv odbc.log /F "%SystemRoot%\\System32\\odbcconf.ini"
```

This command writes diagnostic info to `odbc.log`. Open the file with Notepad and confirm that `MSODBCSQL` is listed.
