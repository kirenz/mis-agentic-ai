If you are using Windows, follow these steps.

## Basic requirements

First, make sure your system is up to date.

- Open `Settings` > Windows Update.

Next, enable Developer Mode:

- Open `Settings` > Update & Security > For developers.
- Toggle Developer Mode and accept the disclaimer. 

## Command-line basics

We use Git Bash as our terminal. Download the latest **Git for Windows** installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and complete the setup (Git Bash is included). After installation, open Git Bash from the Start menu.

Keep the terminal window open while you work through the chapters.
