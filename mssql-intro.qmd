# Microsoft SQL Server

Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It stores data in structured tables, enforces transactional integrity, and provides a rich set of services for analytics, reporting, and integration. 

The platform runs on Windows and Linux, supports on-premises and cloud deployments, and scales from lightweight edge workloads to large enterprise data warehouses.

## What It Is

- **Relational database engine:** Implements the ANSI SQL standard with T-SQL extensions, transactional isolation levels, and ACID compliance.

- **Comprehensive data platform:** Bundles services for business intelligence (SQL Server Analysis Services), data movement (SQL Server Integration Services), and reporting (SQL Server Reporting Services).

- **Managed platform options:** Powers Azure SQL offerings, including Azure SQL Database, Azure SQL Managed Instance, and SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines.

## Typical Use Cases

- Line-of-business applications that require strong transactional consistency (e.g., ERP, CRM, finance).
- Analytical workloads such as data marts and enterprise data warehouses.
- Hybrid architectures combining operational databases with near-real-time analytics through features such as In-Memory OLTP and columnstore indexes.
- Data integration scenarios where SQL Server acts as a hub for ingesting, transforming, and serving data to downstream systems.
