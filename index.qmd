# Syllabus

Welcome to the Agentic AI module of the Management Information Systems course!

In this part of the course, we will explore the world of Agentic Artificial Intelligence. Unlike traditional generaive AI that simply responds to prompts, Agentic AI systems can perceive their environment, reason about tasks, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

## Course Schedule

We will meet for three sessions to learn, build, and present our work.

| Date | Topic |
| -- | -- |
| Week 3, Dec. 8 (14:00-16:00) | Project Kick-off & Fundamentals<br>Introduction to Agentic AI, tooling, and setting up our environment. |
| Week 4, Dec. 15 (14:00-16:00) | Hands-on Development<br>Building a simple agent and exploring design patterns. |
| Week 15, Mar. 9 (14:00-16:00) | Project Presentation<br>Final presentations, project reviews, and reflections. |

## The Project: SQL Analyst Agent

### Objective

As AI consultants to Global Bike Inc. (GBI), the objective is to design and implement a Python-based generative AI solution that enables self-service analytics through an agent capable of generating SQL from natural language. 

The implementation should use Python as the primary language. All components must be included in a GitHub repository.

### The Challenge

GBI has a lot of data in their Microsoft SQL Server, but accessing it requires technical skills. Business users want to ask questions in plain English and get immediate answers. 

### The Solution

Build an AI agent that turns text questions from GBI into safe, correct SQL, executes the query on GBI’s Microsoft SQL Server, and automatically produces both a suitable visualization and a plain-language explanation. The user interface displays the generated SQL, a data table, the visualization, and the explanation.

The end-to-end interaction can follow, as an example, the following path:

    "htmlLabels": false,
    "wrap": true,
    "useMaxWidth": true
  },

    "tertiaryColor": "#ffffff",
    "fontFamily": "system-ui",
    "fontSize": "24px",
    "nodeSpacing": 80,
    "rankSpacing": 80
  }
}}%%

1.  User Input: A user poses a question by text.
2.  Text-to-SQL: The text question is converted into a SQL statement.
3.  Execution: The statement is executed against the SQL Server and the resulting dataset is routed to:
4. A visualization component that selects an appropriate chart based on the data shape.
5. An explanation component that generates a  narrative grounded in the returned numbers.
6. Presentation: The interface then presents the generated SQL, a paginated data table, the selected visualization, and an explanatory summary.

*Note: This flow is provided to illustrate the intended user experience; you may refine it as needed while preserving the core capability of safe text-to-SQL, execution, visualization, and explanation.*

## Deliverables

Deliverables include a GitHub repository containing:

*   All code (agents, guardrails, database connector, and UI).
*   Configuration and prompt templates.
*   Reproducible setup instructions using uv python package manager.
*   A short explanation (one page) describing the architecture, prompts, safety measures, and evaluation procedure.


:::{.callout-note appearance="minimal"}
You will be provided a template BI-Agent repository to get started quickly. 

It's your responsibility to extend and adapt it to meet the project requirements. Especially focus on prompt engineering, Agent design (tool usage) safety measures, and user experience.

Optimize the user interface to display all required outputs (SQL, data table, visualization, explanation) in a clear and user-friendly manner.

## Expected Business Impact

A single natural-language interface that:

*   Reduces analyst bottlenecks.
*   Shortens time-to-insight for sales.
*   Standardizes how data is queried, visualized, and explained across GBI.

## Technologies

*   Python: The primary programming language.
*   Google Gemini (Agent Development Kit): For the intelligence (LLM).
*   Gradio: To build the user interface.
*   Microsoft SQL Server: The database.
*   VS Code: The primary IDE.
*   GitHub: To store and share your code.
*   uv: For Python package management.

## Getting Started
