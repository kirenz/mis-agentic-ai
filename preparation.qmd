Before installing anything, make sure your operating system and accounts are ready. A few minutes of preparation will prevent mysterious permission errors later.

- Windows users: follow the [Windows setup instructions](#windows-users).
- Mac users: follow the [macOS setup instructions](#mac-users).

## Windows users {#windows-users}

### Basic requirements

1. **Check for updates**
   - On Windows, open `Settings` > Windows Update.
2. **Developer mode**
   - Open Windows Settings.
   - Go to Update & Security > For developers.
   - Toggle Developer Mode and accept the disclaimer. This unlocks features used by Git Bash and command-line installers.

### Command-line basics

We use Git Bash as our terminal. Download the latest **Git for Windows** installer from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/download/win) and complete the setup (Git Bash is included). After installation, open **Git Bash** from the Start menu.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true" title="Why Git Bash?"}
Git Bash provides a Unix-like terminal experience on Windows, making it easier to follow along with commands that are commonly used in macOS and Linux environments.

Keep the terminal window open while you work through the chapters.

### Package manager

[**winget**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/) (Windows Package Manager) is already installed on modern Windows builds and can install packages straight from official sources.

`winget` ships with Windows 10 (build 1809 or later) and all versions of Windows 11. Confirm it is ready inside Git Bash:

```bash
winget.exe --version
```

If the command is not found, install the latest [App Installer package](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/app-installer/install-update-app-installer) from the Microsoft Store, restart your machine, and try again.  -->

### uv

We use **uv**, a strictly written Python package manager that is extremely fast. It replaces `pip`, `poetry`, and `virtualenv`.

To install uv on Windows, run this command in your terminal (PowerShell):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

Restart your terminal after installation to ensure `uv` is recognized.


## Mac users {#mac-users}

### Basic requirements

**Check for updates**: On macOS, open `System Settings` > General > Software Update.

### Command-line basics

Launch **Terminal** (Spotlight search for "Terminal"). Commands in this book assume the `zsh` shell, which is the default on modern macOS systems.

Keep the terminal window open while you work through the chapters.

### Package manager

[**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) downloads applications, command line tools, and libraries with one command. You avoid manual downloads and it keeps everything organized.

Install Homebrew:

1. Open Terminal and run the official installer:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```

2. Enter your password when prompted (you won't see any characters while typing).

3. Press RETURN/ENTER to continue

4. When the script finishes, follow the on-screen instructions to add Homebrew to your shell profile (this step is required for `brew` to be found). 

5. Close the Terminal window.

6. Open a new Terminal, then verify the installation:
   ```bash
   brew --version
   ```

7. Make sure everything is up to date:
   ```bash
   brew update
   ```
 
8. Use `brew upgrade` to actually update installed packages.
   
   ```bash
   brew upgrade
   ```


### uv

We use **uv**, a strictly written Python package manager that is extremely fast. It replaces `pip`, `poetry`, and `virtualenv`.

To install uv on macOS, run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Restart your terminal after installation.


## Google API Key

To use Google's AI models (Gemini), you need an API key.

1.  **Get your key**: Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and click **Create API key**.
2.  **Copy the key**: Copy the generated key string.
3.  **Secure your key**:
    *   Create a new file in your project folder named `.env`.
    *   Open the file and add the following line, replacing `YOUR_KEY` with your actual key:

    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
    ```

    *   **Important**: Never share this key or commit the `.env` file to public repositories (GitHub, etc.).
