title: "Server Tools for macOS"

This chapter walks through installing the Microsoft SQL Server ODBC driver and command-line utilities on macOS. Apple Silicon (M1/M2/...) and Intel Macs use the same commands—Homebrew handles the architecture details for you.

## Prerequisites

You need to have [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) installed. If you haven't set it up yet, follow the instructions on their website.

## Install the Microsoft tap and drivers

Microsoft publishes their macOS packages via a dedicated Homebrew tap. Add it and install the required formulas. Open your Terminal and run:

```bash
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
ACCEPT_EULA=Y brew install msodbcsql18 mssql-tools unixodbc
```

- `msodbcsql18` is the latest Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server.
- `mssql-tools` installs `sqlcmd` and `bcp` for command-line access.
- `unixodbc` provides the shared ODBC libraries Python will load.

::: {.callout-important}
The `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` prefix lets the installer know you accept the Microsoft end-user license agreement. Without it the install stops halfway through.

## Add tools to your PATH (if needed)

Some shells require an extra step to expose the SQL Server utilities. Add the following line to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` if `sqlcmd` is not found after reopening Terminal:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/msodbcsql18/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/mssql-tools/bin:$PATH"
```

Intel Macs should use `/usr/local/opt/` instead of `/opt/homebrew/opt/`.

Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```

## Test the installation

Confirm that the ODBC driver registered correctly:

```bash
odbcinst -j
```

Look for lines referencing `Driver Manager: unixODBC`. 


Your Mac is now ready to connect to SQL Server databases from VS Code and Python.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, you can try to download and install the packages manually from Microsoft's website:
