If you are using Mac, follow these steps.

## Basic requirements

First, make sure your system is up to date.

Open `System Settings` > General > Software Update.


## Command-line basics

Launch **Terminal** (Spotlight search for "Terminal"). 

Commands in this book assume the `zsh` shell, which is the default on modern macOS systems.

Keep the terminal window open while you work through the chapters.

## Xcode

Apple's Xcode command line tools are required to build and run some of the code.

Install Xcode command line tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

If you get the following message, you can skip this step:

*xcode-select: note: Command line tools are already installed. Use "Software Update" in System Settings or the softwareupdate command line interface to install updates*


## Package manager

[**Homebrew**](https://brew.sh/) downloads applications, command line tools, and libraries with one command. You avoid manual downloads and it keeps everything organized.

### Install Homebrew

1. Open Terminal and run the official installer:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

2. Enter your password when prompted (you won't see any characters while typing).

3. Press ENTER to continue

4. When the script finishes, follow the on-screen instructions to add Homebrew to your shell profile (this step is required for `brew` to be found). 

5. Close the Terminal window.

6. Open a new Terminal, then verify the installation:

```bash
brew --version
```

### Update Homebrew

If you already have Homebrew installed, make sure everything is up to date:


```bash
brew update
```
 
Use `brew upgrade` to actually update installed packages.
   
```bash
brew upgrade
```

## uv

We use **uv**, a Python package manager that is extremely fast. It replaces `pip`, `poetry`, and `virtualenv`.

To install uv, follow [this guide](https://github.com/kirenz/uv-setup)


## Server Tools

We need to install some drivers for Microsoft SQL Server.

### Install Server Tools

Open your Terminal and run:

```bash
brew tap microsoft/mssql-release https://github.com/Microsoft/homebrew-mssql-release
ACCEPT_EULA=Y brew install msodbcsql18 mssql-tools unixodbc
```

- `msodbcsql18` is the latest Microsoft ODBC Driver for SQL Server.
- `mssql-tools` installs `sqlcmd` and `bcp` for command-line access.
- `unixodbc` provides the shared ODBC libraries Python will load.

::: {.callout-important}
The `ACCEPT_EULA=Y` prefix lets the installer know you accept the Microsoft end-user license agreement. Without it the install stops halfway through.
:::

- Close and reopen Terminal.

### Test the installation

Confirm that the ODBC driver registered correctly:

```bash
odbcinst -j
```

Look for lines referencing `Driver Manager: unixODBC`. 

Your Mac is now ready to connect to SQL Server databases from VS Code and Python.


### Troubleshooting

Some shells require an extra step to expose the SQL Server utilities. Add the following line to `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` if `sqlcmd` is not found after reopening Terminal:

```bash
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/opt/msodbcsql18/bin:/opt/homebrew/opt/mssql-tools/bin:$PATH"
```

Intel Macs should use `/usr/local/opt/` instead of `/opt/homebrew/opt/`.

Reload your shell:

```bash
source ~/.zshrc
```
