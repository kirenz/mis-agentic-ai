# AdventureWorks

We use the AdventureWorks sample database from Microsoft as our primary dataset.

The AdventureWorks database is a realistic, relational dataset that models a mid-sized manufacturing and sales company called *Adventure Works Cycles*.  

It contains data about products, sales, customers, employees, vendors, and production processes, making it ideal for demonstrating complete, data-driven application pipelines.

In this course, the dataset acts as the shared backend for a collection of interactive AI-powered applications. All apps connect to a Microsoft SQL Server instance that hosts the AdventureWorks data.


## What We’ll Build with AdventureWorks

We use the dataset to explore the full AI + data workflow — from SQL querying to intelligent front-end delivery.

Example applications include:

| Area | Technology | Description |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| Natural-language data exploration | Gradio | Ask questions like *“What were the top 5 products by revenue in 2023?”* and get Gemini-generated SQL, data, and charts. |
| Interactive forecasting | Gradio / Streamlit | Build time-series forecasts (e.g., monthly sales by region or product line) with adjustable parameters and downloadable summaries. |
| Automated reporting | Gradio + Quarto | Generate AI-enhanced PDF reports directly from AdventureWorks data, complete with charts and narrative insights. |
| Web dashboards | Next.js | Create modern dashboards that connect to the same SQL backend and use Gemini for intelligent query suggestions. |

AdventureWorks SQL Server is the single source of truth.

Gemini translates natural language into SQL and generates insights.

The front ends (Gradio, Streamlit, Next.js) deliver data, forecasts, and reports interactively.


## Access and API Keys

All participants will receive API keys and connection credentials to access the shared AdventureWorks database.

These keys provide secure, authenticated access from the different front-end applications.

::: {.callout-important}
The API keys and database connection strings will be distributed by the course instructor.
Each key is personal and must not be shared publicly or stored in version control.
