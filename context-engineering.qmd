# Context Engineering

Context engineering is a crucial aspect of building effective AI agents. It involves the strategies and techniques used to provide relevant information to the agent, enabling it to make informed decisions and perform tasks efficiently. 

Proper context engineering ensures that the agent has access to the necessary data, knowledge, and situational awareness required for optimal performance.
