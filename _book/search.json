Load libraries and parse the .env\nimport os\nimport urllib.parse\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine, text\n\nload_dotenv()\nload_dotenv() reads the connection parameters from the .env file so credentials stay out of the source code. If any of the required values (server, database, username, password) are missing, the script aborts with a clear error message—double-check the .env file first.\n\n\n10.2.2 2. Prepare connection parameters\nSERVER = os.getenv(\"MSSQL_SERVER\")\nDATABASE = os.getenv(\"MSSQL_DATABASE\")\nUSERNAME = os.getenv(\"MSSQL_USERNAME\")\nPASSWORD = os.getenv(\"MSSQL_PASSWORD\")\nDRIVER = os.getenv(\"MSSQL_DRIVER\", \"ODBC Driver 18 for SQL Server\")\nTRUST_CERT = os.getenv(\"TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE\", \"false\").lower() == \"true\"\n\nparams = urllib.parse.quote_plus(\n    f\"DRIVER={{{DRIVER}}};\"\n    f\"SERVER={SERVER};\"\n    f\"DATABASE={DATABASE};\"\n    f\"UID={USERNAME};\"\n    f\"PWD={PASSWORD};\"\n    f\"TrustServerCertificate={'Yes' if TRUST_CERT else 'No'};\"\n)\n\nurllib.parse.quote_plus escapes special characters in the password so the ODBC driver accepts the connection string.\nThe TrustServerCertificate flag is controlled via the .env variable TRUST_SERVER_CERTIFICATE and defaults to off.\n\n\n\n10.2.3 3. Create the engine and test the connection\nengine = create_engine(f\"mssql+pyodbc:///?odbc_connect={params}\")\n\nwith engine.connect() as connection:\n    version = connection.execute(text(\"SELECT @@VERSION AS version\"))\n    print(\"Connection successful!\")\n    print(\"SQL Server version:\", version.scalar())\nThe engine manages the connection pool. The with block ensures the session closes properly after the query. The initial SELECT @@VERSION confirms that connectivity works and prints the SQL Server version that responded.\n\n\n10.2.4 4. Sample query with pandas\nSAMPLE_QUERY = text(\n    \"\"\"\n    SELECT TOP (10)\n           ID_Product,\n           Material_Description,\n           Product_Category,\n           Transfer_Price_EUR\n    FROM dbo.Dim_Product\n    ORDER BY ID_Product;\n    \"\"\"\n)\n\ndf = pd.read_sql(SAMPLE_QUERY, connection)\nprint(\"\\nSample data:\")\nprint(df)\npd.read_sql combines SQLAlchemy and pandas so you get a DataFrame directly. The call runs inside the same with block as the version query, meaning the connection closes automatically. Modify the SQL statement to match tables you can access. The goal is to see the data quickly without exporting to CSV first.",
