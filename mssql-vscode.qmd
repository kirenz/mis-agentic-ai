Visual Studio Code acts as your code editor, terminal, and database explorer. This chapter covers the essential extensions and workspace settings for SQL Server work.

## Install VS Code 

If you haven't already, install Visual Studio Code:

- macOS: Download the from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#osx) and drag Visual Studio Code into `Applications`.
- Windows: [Download the installer](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/#win) and click through the setup, leaving the default options enabled (add to PATH, register the code command, etc.).

Launch VS Code once to allow it to finish installing components.

## Essential extensions

Open the Extensions view and install:

1. Python ([ms-python.python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)) – language support and linting.
2. SQL Server (mssql) ([ms-mssql.mssql](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-mssql.mssql)) – database connections and query runner.
3. vscode-icons ([vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscode-icons-team.vscode-icons)) – file icons for better visual identification.



## Enable the `code` command

### macOS Terminal

- Launch VS Code, press `Cmd+Shift+P`, and run Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH.
- Close any open Terminal windows, then open a new one and run

  ```bash
  code --version
  ```

  to confirm the CLI is available.

- From the folder you want to open, run 

  ```bash
  code .
  ```
  to launch VS Code in that location.

### Windows

- From the folder you want to open, run this in Git Bash

  ```bash
  code .
  ```

  to launch VS Code in that location.  

- If the command is missing, add VS Code's `bin` directory to your Git Bash PATH by appending the snippet below to `~/.bashrc` (create the file if it doesn't exist):

    ```bash
    VS_CODE="/c/Users/$USERNAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/bin"
    if [ -d "$VS_CODE" ] && [[ ":$PATH:" != *":$VS_CODE:"* ]]; then
      PATH="$VS_CODE:$PATH"
    fi
    ```

- Reload Git Bash 

  ```bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```
- Try again:

  ```bash
  code .
  ```


## Integrated terminal tips

- Open the integrated terminal in VS Code. On Windows, set Git Bash as the default shell so every VS Code terminal matches the rest of this guide.

- Set your default terminal profile via Terminal > Configure Default Profile… so that VS Code opens the same shell you used during installation.
