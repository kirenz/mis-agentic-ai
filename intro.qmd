# Introduction

Welcome to the **Agentic AI** module of the Management Information Systems course!

In this part of the course, we will explore the cutting-edge world of **Agentic Artificial Intelligence**. Unlike traditional AI that simply responds to prompts, Agentic AI systems can perceive their environment, reason about tasks, and take actions to achieve specific goals.

## Course Schedule

We will meet for three sessions to learn, build, and present our work.

| Week | Date | Topic | Instructor |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **4** | Dec. 15 | **Hands-on Development**<br>Building a simple agent and exploring design patterns. | Prof. Dr. Jan Kirenz |
| **15** | Mar. 9 (14:00-16:00) | **Project Presentation**<br>Final presentations, project reviews, and reflections. | Prof. Dr. Jan Kirenz |

## The Project: Multimodal SQL Analyst Agent

You will act as AI consultants for **Global Bike Inc. (GBI)**, a world-class bicycle manufacturer. Your mission is to build an intelligent AI agent that empowers GBI's employees to get answers from their data instantly.

### The Challenge
GBI has a lot of data in their SQL Server, but accessing it requires technical skills. Business users want to ask questions in plain English (or even by voice!) and get immediate answers.

### Your Solution
You will build a **Multimodal SQL Analyst Agent** that can:

1.  **Listen & Understand**: Accept questions via text or voice.
2.  **Write Code**: Automatically generate safe and correct SQL queries.
3.  **Analyze**: Execute the query on GBI's database.
4.  **Explain & Visualize**: Present the results with a clear text explanation and a beautiful chart.

**Technologies we will use:**

*   **Python**: The primary programming language.
*   **Google Gemini**: For the intelligence (LLM).
*   **Gradio**: To build the user interface.

## Getting Started

To be ready for our first session, please ensure you have the following:

1.  **Google Account**: You will need this to access Google's AI tools.
2.  **Laptop**: Bring your own device.
3.  **Software Setup**: Please complete the steps in the **[Prepare Your Machine](preparation.qmd)** section *before* class. This includes installing Python and setting up your development environment.

We look forward to building the future of analytics with you!
